## Using Go Zero

To use Go Zero, you'll first need to install the command-line tool called `goctl`. Goctl is Go Zero's command-line utility, providing features such as interface definition, error code generation, client code generation, server code generation, and API documentation generation.

### Installing goctl

```bash
GO111MODULE=on go install github.com/zeromicro/go-zero/tools/goctl@latest
```

### Creating a Simple Microservice

```bash
goctl api new greet
```

Feel free to explore Go Zero for your microservices development needs! ðŸš€
